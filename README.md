### Aim of the Project
To build a Machine Learning model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year

### Use cases
Conquering Market Share: Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium for the customers, who are least likely to claim.

Risk Management: Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim insurance in the coming year

Smooth Processing: Reduce the complexity of pricing models. Most of the transactions are happening online with larger customer attributes (thanks to the internet and social media). Harness the power of huge data to build complex ML models

Increased Profits: As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by 10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.
